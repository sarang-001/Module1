## ðŸ“Œ Contents

### 1. Programming Basics
- **Prime Number Checker**: A JavaScript function `isPrime(num)` that determines whether a number is prime.  
- **Calculator Class**: An implementation of a simple calculator with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with unit tests for each method.  

### 2. Data Structures
- **Unique Mobile Numbers**: Demonstrates the use of `Set` in JavaScript by generating 10 random mobile numbers, inserting duplicates, and showcasing the uniqueness property by printing the final set size.  

### 3. Object-Oriented Design
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A simple POM class for a fictional login page. It includes a constructor, a `login(username, password)` method, and sample locators to demonstrate the design pattern.  

### 4. Critical Thinking & Analysis
- **Essay / Presentation**: A 200â€“300 word analysis (or presentation) comparing the pros and cons of **JavaScript, Python, and Java** for automation, with a reasoned justification for the preferred language.
